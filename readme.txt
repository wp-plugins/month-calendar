A calendar widget that shows post count per month.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to have a sidebar widget that shows how many posts you published each month. Displayed like a calendar, you can navigate between years using "previous" and "next" buttons.

Some features include:

*   Data is reloaded using AJAX. This means that changing the year will not reload the whole page.
*   Comes with a bundled CSS file with a default style.
*   The default CSS can be disabled so you can use your theme's CSS file to style it.
*   It's a Widget, so you can move it around your sidebar as you wish.
*   Uses jquery and jquery-ui for AJAX reloading and visual effects.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`. If you're manually copying the files, don't forget to create a `month-calendar` directory first.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins > Installed** menu from the dashboard.
1. Add the **Month Calendar** widget to your sidebar through the **Appearance > Widgets** menu.
1. After you add the widget to your sidebar you will be able to change its settings.
